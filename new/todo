todo and brainstorm

1. new title ideas:
- Euclidean Descriptors of Network Topology

to fix:
- fix first local topology diagram

algorithm-related
- deterministic approximation to FNED using tree-approximation
- characterize complexity of algorithms

experiments-related
- comparison of embeddings based on 0-step, 1-step, 2-step, etc. local topologies (the 1-dim embedding of 0-step should be exactly degree).
- finding use for k-FNED (for however many steps), to show topology around more-rich-structures.
- need to SHOW USE IN SOME EXTERNAL TASK.
    - (X) differences between graphs in terms of node embeddings (why wouldn't you just use graph-edit-distance?)
    - some task where it's useful to cluster local topologies

introduction
- need to emphasize a motivating example for describing network topology in the introduction.
- need to cite any previous examples of topology descriptors (graph embedding is closest?) [put this idea in context] (could also describe how people use node degree in different contexts).
